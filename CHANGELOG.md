# v0.4, 2019-12-26

## Changed

* Changed the order of the output in the macros so that the name of the timer
  is always printed at the beginning of the log line. This makes it easier to
  visually match up log lines.

## Added

* Added an example which contains demonstrations of all the different usages.
